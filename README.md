# Dungeon Revisits

![](https://github.com/Azure-Lazuline/dungeon-revisits/blob/main/screenshot.png?raw=true)

This puts a terminal in front of every dungeon that lets you replay it from the beginning, scaled up to endgame levels. There's actually some leftover unused code in the game itself to do this, but they only just barely started. I decided to spend a few days implementing it myself!

This resets every puzzle, enemy, event, and chest. When replaying an Element dungeon, you need to reclaim the element from its original spot before you're allowed to use it in the dungeon. You can still use it everywhere else if you leave temporarily though.

### Unlocking

Once you've beaten the boss of **Sapphire Ridge**, you unlock all the main dungeons scaled to lv60: Rhombus Dungeon, Temple Mine, Faj'ro Temple, Zir'vitar Temple, So'najiz Temple, and Grand Krys'kajo.

Once you've beaten **Ku'lero Temple** in the postgame, all of them scale up to lv70, and you also unlock Vermillion Tower and Ku'lero Temple.

### Installation

To use, install [ccloader](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader), and go to the "Mods" menu ingame (the button at the *top* of the Options menu, not the tab on the right) and it should be listed there to select and install. You should grab "Difficulty Mods" there too for more customization of enemy power levels, it goes great here.

You can also install manually by placing [the .ccmod file](https://github.com/Azure-Lazuline/dungeon-revisits/releases) in your ccloader mods folder.
